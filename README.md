# SuperStore Sales Analytics & Forecasting Dashboard – Case Study

## 🔎 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a comprehensive sales analytics and forecasting dashboard for a retail SuperStore dataset.
The goal was to build a single, interactive reporting solution that helps business stakeholders monitor performance, identify growth opportunities, and make data-driven decisions using short-term forecasts.

The final solution includes two dashboards:

Sales Performance Dashboard – descriptive analytics

15-Day Sales Forecast Dashboard – predictive analytics

## 1️⃣ The Challenge
